# Flat UCB Tree Search (FUTS)

This is a generic single-threaded reference implementation of the Tree Search
algorithm that is described in Algorithm 1 of
[Aygün, et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06503).

The `search` function requires concrete implementations of two functions:

1. `generate_fn`: This function takes the problem definition and a past
   solution, and generates a new (ideally improved) solution. An actual
   implementation should render a prompt out of the problem description and the
   past solution, feed it to an LLM, and parse the new solution from the LLM's
   response. The example `llm.py` supports `ERA_LLM_PROVIDER=codex` through the
   local Codex CLI, and `ERA_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` through the Gemini API.

2. `execute_fn`: This function takes the problem definition and a candidate
   solution, and assigns a score to the solution in the context of the problem.
   An actual implementation should run the solution in a sandboxed environment
   where all the necessary libraries and data (e.g. training dataset) is
   available, take the generated outputs and evaluate them against the problem
   (e.g. against a test dataset).

Once these functions are provided, the `search` function will iterate
`num_iterations` times, expanding a search tree one node at a time using the
Flat UCB algorithm. When it finishes, it will return the best solution found.
